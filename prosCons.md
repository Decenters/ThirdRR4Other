Should We Have A Third Restroom For Other
=

|A Few Facts|
|:-----:|
|3-5% of the adult population classifies as LGBT|
|There have been several lawsuits on this issue and many public places has began to incorporate third restrooms in their facilities|
|This is considered a form of discrimination|
| California, District of Columbia, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, New Mexico, Rhode Island, and Washington prohibit discrimination based on gender identity.|
|There are more than 150 schools across the U.S. that have gender-neutral bathrooms, according to the University of Massachusetts Amherst's LGBTQ organization The Stonewall Center.|

|Pros | Cons |
|:------:|:---------:|
|The other section wants a third restroom | The 'Other' section might feel discriminated against.|
| Less abuse of those considered to be other| Backlash from anti- "non-natural" establishments|
| Less possibility of perversion| And an increase in perversion|
| The happiness that they will feel is more than enough.| There is still the fact of what sex they identify themselves as. They will feel happiness, but we cannot remove the face that they would still want to go to the restroom of the assigned sex they consider themselves as|
| An increase tin the fact that the world keeps on evolving, changing, some for the better and some for the worse. This is a double edged sword, and we cannot dull one side.| An increase in lawsuits, not from the 'other' but from the group that has nothing to do. In other words, doesnt realize that the 'other' are humans too.|

How This Relates To The Us. Constitution
=
The Civil Rights Act of 1964, which ended segregation in public places and banned employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin, is considered one of the crowning legislative achievements of the civil rights movement. First proposed by President John F. Kennedy, it survived strong opposition from southern members of Congress and was then signed into law by Kennedyâ€™s successor, Lyndon B. Johnson. In subsequent years, Congress expanded the act and also passed additional legislation aimed at bringing equality to African Americans, such as the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

Our Side
=
Yes, we should not. The biology of the human allows for only two sexes, male and female. There is no denying that. A change in gender identity or sexual classification does not=, in anyway change the fact that sex is determined by two chromosomes, and powerful ones at that. That is the way that public restrooms were established, one for male, and one for female. To please the 'Other group', we suggest a unisex restroom. This avoids the unisex thing and give those that have nothing to do something else to argue about. We cannot please most of the other group as too many "genders" can be classified.

To end off
=
Confllict will always exist in this world, and the silly ones will take the majority. The number of conflict(s) will also increase. BUT we, us, not as on, not as a group, but as a global society can slow the increase. We are humans and nothing more, but nothing less. We can easily conquer and destroy one another, and do it fur fun. So I ask you this, would you like to defecate like a king, or like an abused dog?
